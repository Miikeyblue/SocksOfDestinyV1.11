Socks of Destiny – Shifty Eyes Patch (v15)

✅ Change implemented:
- When a player rolls a 1, a shifty eyes animation appears and plays "Shhh..." audio.

🎵 Important:
Place your audio file here (case-sensitive):
  /sounds/Shhh.mp3

This patch expects EXACTLY that filename: Shhh.mp3
(If your file is named differently, rename it to Shhh.mp3)

If you're using the service worker (PWA caching), the cache name has been bumped to sod-full-v15,
and Shhh.mp3 has been added to the cache asset list.
